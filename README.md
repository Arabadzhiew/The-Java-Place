# TheJavaPlace

  

## The goal

This web application was created with one single goal in mind - to be a place where you can go to and get any of your questions, regarding Java and related technologies answered.

  

## To run the application

1. If you don't already have a MySQL user, now is the time to create one.

2. To create the database, run all of the queries inside the `create.sql` file, which is located in the `database` folder.

3. Download the MySQL JDBC driver and insert it into the Tomcat /lib folder.

4. Update Tomcatâ€™s JNDI resources to point to the new database. In order to do this you need to insert a new Resource entity in the context.xml file. Here is an example from my Tomcat 9 instance:

```

<Resource name="jdbc/TheJavaPlace" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
maxActive="20" maxIdle="5" maxWait="10000"
username="tomcatUser" password="insertYourPasswordHere"
driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
defaultTransactionIsolation="READ_COMMITTED"
url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/TheJavaPlace"/>

```

5. Configure a HTTPS port for your Tomcat instance. This is achieved by inserting a new Connector entity inside of Tomcat's server.xml file. Here is an example from my Tomcat 9 instance:

```

<Connector SSLEnabled="true" port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" scheme="https" secure="true">
	<SSLHostConfig>
		<Certificate certificateKeystoreFile="/directory/to/your/ssl/certificate" certificateKeystorePassword="insertPasswordHere" type="RSA"/>
	</SSLHostConfig>
</Connector>

```

  

6. Import the project into your IDE.

7. Compile and run the application.

8. Go to `localhost:8443/tjp` or `localhost:8080/tjp` (Spring security will automatically redirect you to port 8443, which is the default for HTTPS).

Now that you are a part of TheJavaPlace, you can create read update and delete threads and comments, browse user profiles and look trough their activity history, customise your profile image and do full text searches on threads. But be careful with your actions, our admins can alter every single action of the ones mentioned above, and if you are not behaving appropriately your account may get suspended.

If you have forgotten your password, don't worry. We've got you covered. From the login page, go on to the `Forgot your password?` tab, enter your email and click send. A recovery message with instructions will be sent to the email address you entered, if there is a user registered with it.

  

## This application was build using:

  

Back end:

The server side code of this application was written in Java JDK 16, using the Model View Controller, Service layer and Repository architectural design patterns, while utilising the following Spring projects:

- Spring Framework;

- Spring Data JPA - With `Hibernate` as the ORM implementation;

- Spring Security;

  

Database:

  

![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

  

A single MySQL database, that consists of 5 tables with different relationships between one another is being used. MySQL's full text searching capabilities are being utilised in the searching functionality of the application.

Front end:

  

`Java Server Pages (JSP)` are being used extensively in the client side of the application, with a pinch of `JavaScript` DOM manipulation and usage of the `XMLHttpRequest` object. `Bootstrap v5.0` is also being used extensively in order to give the web app a clean and responsive design.
